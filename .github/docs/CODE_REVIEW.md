# Code Review - Best Practices

## It is recommended to analyze the following items during the review

---

– Does it fit into the existing architecture?

– Does it follow the standards adopted by the team in the project?

– Is the code in the right place?

– Is there code reuse?

– Is the complexity too high?

– Do the names that were used in variables, fields, parameters, classes and methods reflect what it really represents?

– Only by reading the code is it possible to understand what it does?

– Does the code contain a Bug, a wrong comparison?


## Best practices in code review

---

– Be clear in communication.

– Be polite, give constructive criticism. **The intent is to solve the problem.**

– Don't try to reinvent the wheel.
